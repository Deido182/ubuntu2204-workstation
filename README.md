# ubuntu2204-workstation
Just a minimal workstation for getting practice with containers (are you attending RedHat DO180 too?). It is run by ```docker``` and includes ```podman``` as container engine. All data stored inside are volatile, except those under <i>/persistent-storage</i>. <i>logs</i> stores exactly what the name suggests.
Provided that you both have ```docker``` installed and are a sudoer, ```uws-install``` should install all the stuff. Hopefully, ```uws-run``` should then work as well (<i>sigh</i>).
